## 🔮 Guess the Number

A fun and interactive browser-based game that guesses the number you're thinking of (between 0 and 31) using binary math tricks and a sleek UI.

---

### 🧠 How It Works

The trick behind the game is binary representation. The app shows you 5 sets of numbers (0–31), and asks:
> "Is your number in this list?"

Each list corresponds to a bit position (1, 2, 4, 8, 16). Based on your **Yes/No** responses, the program calculates your number using bitwise addition.
